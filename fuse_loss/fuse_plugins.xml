  <!--
  Loss functions are M-estimators that take the squared norm of a residual block 'r' and try to reduce the effect of
  outliers by replacing the squared residuals 's = r^2' used in the standard Least-Squares problem by another function
  of the squared residuals `rho(s)`.

  For this reason loss functions are also known as robustifiers.

  In the notation used here, `rho(s)` takes the squared residuals `s` as an input, not the residuals `r`, as in Ceres
  solver.

  <class type="fuse_loss::ArctanLoss" base_class_type="fuse_core::Loss">
    <description>
    Loss function that is capped beyond a certain level using the arc-tangent function, with scaling parameter 'a' that
    determines the level where falloff occurs. For costs much smaller than 'a', the loss function is linear and behaves
    like TrivialLoss, and for values much larger than 'a' the value asymptotically approaches the constant value of
    'a * PI / 2'. It is defined as follows for the residual 's':

    rho(s) = a * atan2(s, a)

  <class type="fuse_loss::CauchyLoss" base_class_type="fuse_core::Loss">
    <description>
    Loss function inspired by the Cauchy distribution, with scaling parameter 'a', defined as follows for the residual
    's':

    rho(s) = b * log(1 + s * c)

    where b = a^2 and c = 1 / b.

  <class type="fuse_loss::HuberLoss" base_class_type="fuse_core::Loss">
    <description>
    Huber loss function with scaling parameter 'a', defined as follows for the residual 's':

    rho(s) = 2 * a * sqrt(s) - b  if s > b   // outlier region
           = s                    otherwise  // inlier region

    where b = a^2.

  <class type="fuse_loss::ScaledLoss" base_class_type="fuse_core::Loss">
    <description>
      The other basic loss function has to do with length scalingi, i.e. they affect the space in which 's' is measured.
      Sometimes you want to simply scale the output value of the robustifier.

      If '\hat{rho}' is the wrapped robustifier, then this simply outputs:

      rho(s) = a * \hat{rho(s)}

      If '\hat{rho}' is not given, it is set as NULL and is treated as the Trivial loss function, iso we get:

      rho(s) = a * s

  <class type="fuse_loss::SoftLOneLoss" base_class_type="fuse_core::Loss">
    <description>
    Soft L1 loss function with scaling parameter 'a', that is similar to Huber but smooth, defined as follows for the
    residual 's':

    rho(s) = 2 * b * (sqrt(1 + s * c) - 1)

    where b = a^2 and c = 1 / b.
    </description>
  </class>
  <class type="fuse_loss::TolerantLoss" base_class_type="fuse_core::Loss">
    <description>
    Loss function that maps to approximately zero cost in a range around the origin, and reverts to linear in error
    (quadratic in cost) beyond this range. The tolerance parameter 'a' sets the nominal point at which the transition
    occurs, and the transition size parameter 'b' sets the nominal distance over which most of the transition occurs.
    Both 'a' and 'b' must be reater than zero, and typically 'b' will be set to a fraction of 'a'. It is defined as
    follows for the residual 's':

    rho(s) = b * log(1 + exp((s - a) / b)) - c0

    where c0 = b * log(1 + exp(-a / b)).

  <class type="fuse_loss::TrivialLoss" base_class_type="fuse_core::Loss">
    <description>
    This corresponds to no robustification. It is not normally necessary to use this, as setting not loss function
    accomplishes the same thing.

    rho(s) = s

  <class type="fuse_loss::TukeyLoss" base_class_type="fuse_core::Loss">
    <description>
    Tukey biweight loss function which aggressively attempts to suppress large errors, with scaling parameter 'a',
    defined as follows for the residual 's':

    rho(s) = a^2 / 6                          if s > a^2  // inlier region
           = a^2 / 6 * (1 - (1 - s / a^2)^3)  otherwise   // outlier region
