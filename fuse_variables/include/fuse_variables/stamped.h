/**
 * @brief Load a device id from the parameter server
 *
 * This function first checks if the 'device_id' parameter is available. If so, it attempts to load the device_id
 * using that parameter. There are a few supported formats:
 * - "01234567-89AB-CDEF-0123-456789ABCDEF"
 * - "01234567-89ab-cdef-0123-456789abcdef"
 * - "0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef"
 * - "{01234567-89ab-cdef-0123-456789abcdef}"
 *
 * If the 'device_id' parameter doesn't exist, this function checks for the 'device_name' parameter. If found, a
 * device_id is generated by computing a hash on the provided string. See fuse_core::uuid::generate(const std::string&)
 * for details.
 *
 * If neither parameter exits, the device_id is populated by all zeros, the so-called NIL UUID.
 *
 * Will throw if the device_id parameter is not in an expected format.
 *
 * @param[in] node_handle A node handle in the desired parameter namespace
 * @return                A device UUID
