 * @brief A LocalParameterization class for 2D Orientations.
 *
 * 2D orientations add and subtract in the "usual" way, except for the 2*pi rollover issue. This local parameterization
 * handles the rollover. Because the Jacobians for this parameterization are always identity, we implement this
 * parameterization with "analytic" derivatives, instead of using the Ceres's autodiff system.
