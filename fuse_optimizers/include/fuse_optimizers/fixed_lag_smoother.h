/**
 * @brief A fixed-lag smoother implementation that marginalizes out variables that are older than a defined lag time
 *
 * This implementation assumes that all added variable types are either derived from the fuse_variables::Stamped class,
 * or are directly connected to at least one fuse_variables::Stamped variable via a constraint. The current time of
 * the fixed-lag smoother is determined by the newest stamp of all added fuse_variables::Stamped variables.
 *
 * During optimization:
 *  (1) new variables and constraints are added to the graph
 *  (2) the augmented graph is optimized and the variable values are updated
 *  (3) all motion models, sensors, and publishers are notified of the updated graph
 *  (4) all variables older than "current time - lag duration" are marginalized out.
 *
 * Optimization is performed at a fixed frequency, controlled by the \p optimization_frequency parameter. Received
 * sensor transactions are queued while the optimization is processing, then applied to the graph at the start of the
 * next optimization cycle. If the previous optimization is not yet complete when the optimization period elapses,
 * then a warning will be logged but a new optimization will *not* be started. The previous optimization will run to
 * completion, and the next optimization will not begin until the next scheduled optimization period.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *  - lag_duration (float, default: 5.0) The duration of the smoothing window in seconds
 *  - motion_models (struct array) The set of motion model plugins to load
 *    @code{.yaml}
 *    - name: string  (A unique name for this motion model)
 *      type: string  (The plugin loader class string for the desired motion model type)
 *    - ...
 *    @endcode
 *  - optimization_frequency (float, default: 10.0) The target frequency for optimization cycles. If an optimization
 *                                                  takes longer than expected, an optimization cycle may be skipped.
 *  - publishers (struct array) The set of publisher plugins to load
 *    @code{.yaml}
 *    - name: string  (A unique name for this publisher)
 *      type: string  (The plugin loader class string for the desired publisher type)
 *    - ...
 *    @endcode
 *  - sensor_models (struct array) The set of sensor model plugins to load
 *    @code{.yaml}
 *    - name: string  (A unique name for this sensor model)
 *      type: string  (The plugin loader class string for the desired sensor model type)
 *      motion_models: [name1, name2, ...]  (An optional list of motion model names that should be applied)
 *    - ...
 *    @endcode
 *  - transaction_timeout (float, default: 0.10) The maximum time to wait for motion models to be generated for a
 *                                               received transactions. Transactions are processes sequentially, so
 *                                               no new transactions will be added to the graph while waiting for
 *                                               motion models to be generated. Once the timeout expires, that
 *                                               transaction will be deleted from the queue.
