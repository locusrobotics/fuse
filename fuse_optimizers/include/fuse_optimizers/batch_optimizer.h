/**
 * @brief A simple optimizer implementation that uses batch optimization
 *
 * The batch optimization takes place in a separate thread. Received sensor transactions are queued while the
 * optimization is processing, then applied to the graph at the start of the next optimization cycle. Optimization
 * cycles are started at a fixed frequency. If the previous optimization is not yet complete when the optimization
 * period elapses, then a new optimization will not be started. The previous optimization will run to completion, and
 * the next optimization will not begin until the next scheduled optimization period. For batch optimization problems
 * that continuously grow in size, this means that the optimization period is not overly important. The time spent
 * waiting versus the time spent optimizing will approach zero as the problem size increases.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *  - motion_models (struct array) The set of motion model plugins to load
 *    @code{.yaml}
 *    - name: string  (A unique name for this motion model)
 *      type: string  (The plugin loader class string for the desired motion model type)
 *    - ...
 *    @endcode
 *  - optimization_period (float, default: 10.0) The minimum time delay, in seconds, between optimization cycles.
 *  - publishers (struct array) The set of publisher plugins to load
 *    @code{.yaml}
 *    - name: string  (A unique name for this publisher)
 *      type: string  (The plugin loader class string for the desired publisher type)
 *    - ...
 *    @endcode
 *  - sensor_models (struct array) The set of sensor model plugins to load
 *    @code{.yaml}
 *    - name: string  (A unique name for this sensor model)
 *      type: string  (The plugin loader class string for the desired sensor model type)
 *      motion_models: [name1, name2, ...]  (An optional list of motion model names that should be applied)
 *    - ...
 *    @endcode
 *  - transaction_timeout (float, default: 10.0) The maximum time to wait for motion models to be generated for a
 *                                               received transactions. Transactions are processes sequentially, so
 *                                               no new transactions will be added to the graph while waiting for
 *                                               motion models to be generated. Once the timeout expires, that
 *                                               transaction will be deleted from the queue.
