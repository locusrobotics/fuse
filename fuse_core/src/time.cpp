 * This file provides a sane configuration for a clock to manage order of events.
 * This file exists to help with a migration from ros::time to rclcpp::time
 * Priority is given to C++ std::chrono
 * emphasis will be placed on interoperability with ros::time and rclcpp::time
 * 
 * This will likely be extended to distinguish between:
 *    times of events being optimised
 *    events generated by the running of the optimiser (log throttling, callbacks etc)
