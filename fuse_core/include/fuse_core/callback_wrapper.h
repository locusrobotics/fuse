/**
 * @brief Object that wraps a generic function call so that it may be inserted into a ROS callback queue.
 *
 * Once inserted, the function will be called from within the thread that services that callback queue. It will be
 * intermingled with any other standard ROS callbacks (message subscription callbacks, service callbacks, timer
 * callbacks, etc.), analogous to adding callbacks for an additional topic subscriber.
 *
 * boost::bind/std::bind can be used to provide input arguments. Note that bind() uses a pass-by-value mechanism. If
 * arguments should be passed by reference instead (i.e. copies are expensive or the function modifies the input in
 * place), wrap the input arguments with boost::ref() or std::ref().
 *
 * The CallbackWrapper class uses the C++11 promise/future mechanism to provide the return data after the callback has
 * been executed in the callback queue's thread. This is done by getting a future<T> from the CallbackWrapper before it
 * is inserted into the callback queue. You can then block until the return value is ready by calling future.wait(),
 * and the value can be retrieved using future.get(). Even if the function returns void, it can still be useful to get
 * a copy of the CallbackWrapper's future. The future.wait() function is still valid for void types, thus allowing you
 * to block until the callback function has been executed.
 *
 * See C++11 documentation for more details on promises and futures:
 * - http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/promise
 * - http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/future
 *
 * Example usage:
 * @code{.cpp}
 * class MyClass
 * {
 * public:
 *   double processData(const std::vector<double>& data)
 *   {
 *     return std::accumulate(data.begin(), data.end(), 0.0);
 *   }
 * };
 *
 * MyClass my_object;
 * std::vector<double> really_big_data(1000000);
 * auto callback = boost::make_shared<CallbackWrapper<double> >(
 *   std::bind(&MyClass::processData, &my_object, std::ref(really_big_data)));
 * std::future<double> result = callback->getFuture();
 * ros::getGlobalCallbackQueue()->addCallback(callback);
 * result.wait();
 * ROS_INFO_STREAM("The result is: " << result.get());
 * @endcode
