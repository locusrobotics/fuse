/**
 * @brief A motion model base class that provides node handles and a private callback queue.
 *
 * A model model plugin is responsible for generating constraints that link together timestamps introduced by other
 * sensors in the system. The AsyncMotionModel class is designed similar to a nodelet, attempting to be as generic
 * and easy to use as a standard ROS node.
 *
 * There are a few notable differences between the AsyncMotionModel class and a standard ROS node. First and most
 * obvious, the AsyncMotionModel class is designed as a plugin, with all of the stipulations and requirements that
 * come with all ROS plugins (must be derived from a known base class, will be default constructed). Second, the
 * AsyncMotionModel class provides a global and private node handle, both hooked to a local callback queue and local
 * spinner. This makes it act like a full ROS node -- subscriptions trigger message callbacks, callbacks will fire
 * sequentially, etc. However, authors of derived classes should be aware of this fact and avoid creating additional
 * node handles, or at least take care when creating new node handles and additional callback queues. Finally, the
 * interaction of motion model nodes is best compared to a service call -- an external actor will provide a set of
 * timestamps and wait for the motion model to respond with the required set of constraints to link the timestamps
 * together (along with any previously existing timestamps). In lieu of a ROS service callback function, the
 * AsyncMotionModel class requires the queryCallback() function to be implemented. This callback will be executed
 * from the same callback queue as any other subscriptions or service callbacks.
 * 
 * Derived classes:
 * - _probably_ need to implement the onInit() method. This method is used to configure the motion model for operation.
 *   This includes things like accessing the parameter server and subscribing to sensor topics.
 * - _must_ implement the queryCallback() method. This is the communication mechanism between the parent/optimizer and
 *   the derived motion model. This is how the optimizer tells the motion model what timestamps have been added, and
 *   how the motion model sends motion model constraints to the optimizer.
 * - may _optionally_ implement the onGraphUpdate() method. This should only be done if the derived motion model needs
 *   access to the latest values of the state variables. In many cases, motion models will simply not need that
 *   information. If the motion model does need access the to graph, the most common implementation will simply be to
 *   move the provided pointer into a class memebr variable, for use in other callbacks.
 *   @code{.cpp}
 *   void onGraphUpdate(Graph::ConstSharedPtr graph) override { this->graph_ = std::move(graph); }
