/**
 * @brief The Variable interface definition.
 *
 * A Variable defines some semantically meaningful group of one or more individual scale values. Each variable is
 * treated as a block by the optimization engine, as the values of all of its dimensions are likely to be involved
 * in the same constraints. Some common examples of variable groupings are a 2D point (x, y), 3D point (x, y, z), or
 * camera calibration parameters (fx, fy, cx, cy).
 *
 * To support the Ceres optimization engine, the Variable must hold the scalar values of each dimension in a
 * _contiguous_ memory space, and must provide access to that memory location via the Variable::data() methods.
 *
 * Some Variables may require special update rules, either because they are over-parameterized, as is the case with
 * 3D rotations represented as quaternions, or because the update of the individual dimensions exhibit some nonlinear
 * properties, as is the case with rotations in general (e.g. 2D rotations have a discontinuity around &pi;). To
 * support these situations, Ceres uses an optional "local parameterization". See the Ceres documentation for more
 * details. http://ceres-solver.org/nnls_modeling.html#localparameterization

   * different timestamps but the same UUID will be incorrectly treated as the same variable.
   *
   * One method of producing UUIDs that adhere to this requirement is to use the boost::uuid::name_generator() function.
   * The type() string can be used to generate a UUID namespace for all variables of a given derived type, and the
