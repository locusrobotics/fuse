 * @brief The interface definiton for sensor model plugins in the fuse ecosystem.
 *
 * A sensor model plugin is responsible for generating new constraints and passing them along to the optimizer, where
 * the actual sensor fusion takes place. This class defines the basic interface between the sensor model and the
 * optimizer. If you are developing your own sensor model, look at the AsyncSensorModel class, as this provides
 * additional features that make the sensor model act similar to a ROS node or nodelet.
 *
 * The interface SensorModel class provides the injectCallback() function. This function serves the same basic purpose
 * as publishing a Transaction using a standard ROS publisher, but this method is specific to sensor models and the
 * fuse ecosystem. Under the hood, this inserts a call into the fuse optimizer's callback queue, just as publishing a
 * message would, but the memory copy and serialization are avoided. Derived classes should call this method whenever
 * they are ready to send a fuse_core::Transaction object to the optimizer.
