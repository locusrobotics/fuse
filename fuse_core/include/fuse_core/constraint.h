/**
 * @brief The Constraint interface definition.
 *
 * A Constraint defines a cost function that is connected to one or more variables. This base class defines the
 * required interface of all Constraint objects, and holds the ordered list of involved variable UUIDs. All other
 * functionality is left to the derived classes to implement.
 *
 * Most importantly, the implementation of the cost function is left to the derived classes, allowing arbitrarily
 * complex sensor models to be implemented outside of the core fuse packages. The cost function must be a valid
 * ceres::CostFunction object. Ceres provides many nice features to make implementing the cost function easier,
 * including an automatic differentiation system. Please see the Ceres documentation for details on creating valid
 * ceres::CostFunction objects (http://ceres-solver.org/nnls_modeling.html). In addition to the cost function itself,
 * an optional loss function may be provided. Loss functions provide a mechanism for reducing the impact of outlier
 * measurements on the final optimization results. Again, see the Ceres documentation for details
 * (http://ceres-solver.org/nnls_modeling.html#lossfunction).
