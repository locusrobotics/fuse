/**
 * @brief An adapter-type sensor that produces absolute or relative pose constraints from information published by
 * another node.
 *
 * This sensor subscribes to a geometry_msgs::PoseWithCovarianceStamped topic and converts each received message
 * into an absolute or relative pose constraint. If the \p differential parameter is set to false (the default), the
 * measurement will be treated as an absolute constraint. If it is set to true, consecutive measurements will be used
 * to generate relative pose constraints.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *  - device_id (uuid string, default: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000) The device/robot ID to publish
 *  - device_name (string) Used to generate the device/robot ID if the device_id is not provided
 *  - queue_size (int, default: 10) The subscriber queue size for the pose messages
 *  - topic (string) The topic to which to subscribe for the pose messages (required if \p subscribe is true)
 *  - differential (bool, default: false) Whether we should fuse measurements absolutely, or to create relative pose
 *      constraints using consecutive measurements.
 *
 * Subscribes:
 *  - \p topic (geometry_msgs::PoseWithCovarianceStamped) Absolute pose information at a given timestamp
