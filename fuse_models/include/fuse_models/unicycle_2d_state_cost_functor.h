/**
 * @brief Create a cost function for a 2D state vector
 * 
 * The state vector includes the following quantities, given in this order:
 *   x position
 *   y position
 *   yaw (rotation about the z axis)
 *   x velocity
 *   yaw velocity
 *   x acceleration
 *   y acceleration
 *
 * The Ceres::NormalPrior cost function only supports a single variable. This is a convenience cost function that
 * applies a prior constraint on both the entire state vector.
 *
 * The cost function is of the form:
 *
 *             ||    [        x_t2 - proj(x_t1)       ] ||^2
 *   cost(x) = ||    [        y_t2 - proj(y_t1)       ] ||
 *             ||    [      yaw_t2 - proj(yaw_t1)     ] ||
 *             ||A * [    x_vel_t2 - proj(x_vel_t1)   ] ||
 *             ||    [    y_vel_t2 - proj(y_vel_t1)   ] ||
 *             ||    [  yaw_vel_t2 - proj(yaw_vel_t1) ] ||
 *             ||    [    x_acc_t2 - proj(x_acc_t1)   ] ||
 *             ||    [    y_acc_t2 - proj(y_acc_t1)   ] ||
 * 
 * where, the matrix A is fixed, the state variables are provided at two discrete time steps, and proj is a function
 * that projects the state variables from time t1 to time t2. In case the user is interested in implementing a cost
 * function of the form
 *
 *   cost(X) = (X - mu)^T S^{-1} (X - mu)
 *
 * where, mu is a vector and S is a covariance matrix, then, A = S^{-1/2}, i.e the matrix A is the square root
 * information matrix (the inverse of the covariance).
