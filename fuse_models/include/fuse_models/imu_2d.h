/**
 * @brief An adapter-type sensor that produces orientation (relative or absolute), angular velocity, and linear
 * acceleration constraints from IMU sensor data published by another node
 *
 * This sensor subscribes to a sensor_msgs::Imu topic and:
 *   1. Creates relative or absolute orientation and constraints. If the \p differential parameter is set to false (the
 *      default), the orientation measurement will be treated as an absolute constraint. If it is set to true,
 *      consecutive measurements will be used to generate relative orientation constraints.
 *   2. Creates 2D velocity variables and constraints.
 *
 * This sensor really just separates out the orientation, angular velocity, and linear acceleration components of the
 * message, and processes them just like the pose_2d::Model, twist_2d::Model, and acceleration_2d::Model classes.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *  - device_id (uuid string, default: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000) The device/robot ID to publish
 *  - device_name (string) Used to generate the device/robot ID if the device_id is not provided
 *  - queue_size (int, default: 10) The subscriber queue size for the pose messages
 *  - topic (string) The topic to which to subscribe for the pose messages
 *  - differential (bool, default: false) Whether we should fuse orientation measurements absolutely, or to create
 *      relative orientation constraints using consecutive measurements.
 *  - remove_gravitational_acceleration (bool, default: false) Whether we should remove acceleration due to gravity
 *      from the acceleration values produced by the IMU before fusing
 *  - gravitational_acceleration (double, default: 9.80665) Acceleration due to gravity, in meters/sec^2. This value is
 *      only used if \p remove_gravitational_acceleration is true
 *  - orientation_target_frame (string) Orientation data will be transformed into this frame before it is fused.
 *  - twist_target_frame (string) Twist/velocity data will be transformed into this frame before it is fused.
 *  - acceleration_target_frame (string) Acceleration data will be transformed into this frame before it is fused.
 *
 * Subscribes:
 *  - \p topic (sensor_msgs::Imu) IMU data at a given timestep
