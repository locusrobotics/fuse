/**
 * @brief A fuse_models 2D kinematic model that generates kinematic constraints between provided time stamps, and adds
 * those constraints to the fuse graph.
 *
 * This class uses a unicycle kinematic model for the robot. It is equivalent to the motion model that one would have
 * if setting all 3D variable values to 0 in the robot_localization state estimation nodes.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *  - ~device_id (uuid string, default: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000) The device/robot ID to publish
 *  - ~device_name (string) Used to generate the device/robot ID if the device_id is not provided
 *  - ~buffer_length (double) The length of the graph state buffer and state history, in seconds
 *  - ~process_noise_diagonal (vector of doubles) An 8-dimensional vector containing the diagonal values for the
 *                                                process noise covariance matrix. Variable order is (x, y, yaw,
 *                                                x_vel, y_vel, yaw_vel, x_acc, y_acc).
