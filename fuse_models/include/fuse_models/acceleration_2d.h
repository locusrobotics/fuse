 * @brief An adapter-type sensor that produces 2D linear acceleration constraints from information published by another

 *
 * This sensor subscribes to a geometry_msgs::AccelWithCovarianceStamped topic and converts each received message

 *
 * Parameters:
 *  - device_id (uuid string, default: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000) The device/robot ID to publish
 *  - device_name (string) Used to generate the device/robot ID if the device_id is not provided
 *  - queue_size (int, default: 10) The subscriber queue size for the twist messages
 *  - target_frame (string) The target frame_id to transform the data into before using it
 *  - topic (string) The topic to which to subscribe for the twist messages
 *
 * Subscribes:
 *  - \p topic (geometry_msgs::AccelWithCovarianceStamped) Acceleration information at a given timestamp
