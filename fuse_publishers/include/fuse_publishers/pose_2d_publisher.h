/**
 * @brief Publisher plugin that publishes the latest 2D pose (combination of Position2DStamped and Orientation2DStamped)
 *
 * There are several options: the latest pose can be sent to the tf topic, just the pose can be published, or the pose
 * and the covariance can be published.
 *
 * The tf operation is not straight forward. The standard ROS frame conventions are map->odom->base_link. The
 * odom->base_link frame is generally published by a separate odometry system (robot driver node, robot_localization
 * node, robot_pose_ekf node, etc.). If this node published a map->base_link transform, the tf system would no longer
 * form a tree (the base_link node would have multiple parents), which breaks the tf system. Instead, we want to
 * publish the map->odom transform. If the map->base_link transform is desired, the odom frame may be set to an empty
 * string. Additionally, the tf system requires transforms to be available both before and after a requested timestamp
 * before it will compute a transform. If this plugin only published transforms after each successful cycle of the
 * optimizer, the map->odom transform will become old or stale as the optimization time increases. To prevent this,
 * the map->odom transform is published in response to an independent timer, and the timestamp of the transform is
 * updated to the current publication time. Although this is "wrong", it keeps the tf tree populated with recent
 * transform data so that other nodes can execute tf queries.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *  - base_frame (string, default: base_link)  Name for the robot's base frame
 *  - device_id (uuid string, default: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000) The device/robot ID to publish
 *  - device_name (string) Used to generate the device/robot ID if the device_id is not provided
 *  - map_frame (string, default: map)  Name for the robot's map frame
 *  - odom_frame (string, default: odom)  Name for the robot's odom frame (or {empty} if the frame map->base should be
 *                                        published to tf instead of map->odom)
 *  - publish_to_tf (bool, default: false)  Flag indicating that the optimized pose should be published to tf
 *  - tf_cache_time (seconds, default: 10.0)  How long to keep a history of transforms (for map->odom lookup)
 *  - tf_publish_frequency (Hz, default: 10.0)  How often the latest pose should be published to tf
 *  - tf_timeout (seconds, default: 0.1)  The maximum amount of time to wait for a transform to become available
 *
 * Publishes:
 *  - pose (geometry_msgs::PoseStamped)  The most recent optimized robot pose (i.e. the map->base transform)
 *  - pose_with_covariance (geometry_msgs::PoseWithCovarianceStamped)  The most recent optimized robot pose and
 *                                                                     covariance (i.e. the map->base transform)
 *  - tf (tf2_msgs::TFMessage)  The most recent map->odom transform (or map->base if the odom_frame is empty)
 *
 * Subscribes:
 *  - tf, tf_static (tf2_msgs::TFMessage)  Used to lookup the current odom->base frame, if needed
