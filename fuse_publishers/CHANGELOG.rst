0.4.2 (2021-07-20)
------------------
* Adding roslint dependency to fuse_viz (`#231 <https://github.com/locusrobotics/fuse/issues/231>`_)
  * Adding roslint dependency to fuse_viz
  * Silence CMP0048 warnings
* Contributors: Tom Moore

0.4.1 (2021-07-13)
------------------
* Fixing license
* Support throttling serialized graph publisher (`#204 <https://github.com/locusrobotics/fuse/issues/204>`_)
  * Change sensor proc from gtest to gmock target
  * Move ThrottledCallback to fuse_core
  * Support generic callbacks in ThrottledCallback
  * Throttle graph publishing
  * Overload getPositiveParam for ros::Duration
  * Use getPositiveParam for ros::Duration parameters
* Set latch param in serialized publisher to false by default (`#184 <https://github.com/locusrobotics/fuse/issues/184>`_)
* Add latch param to serialized publisher (`#165 <https://github.com/locusrobotics/fuse/issues/165>`_)
* Use transaction stamp in SerializedPublisher (`#147 <https://github.com/locusrobotics/fuse/issues/147>`_)
  By using the transaction stamp instead of `ros::Time::now()` it's
  possible to replay things with the same transaction and compare the
  original and new generated graphs.
* Removed the explicit '-std=c++14' compile flag (`#119 <https://github.com/locusrobotics/fuse/issues/119>`_)
  * Removed the explicit '-std=c++14' compile flag
  * Changed the CXX_STANDARD setting to be per-target instead of global
  * Added the CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED setting to all targets
* fix compilation in Kinetic (`#112 <https://github.com/locusrobotics/fuse/issues/112>`_)
* [RST-2149] Added the configured device_id to the log message (`#110 <https://github.com/locusrobotics/fuse/issues/110>`_)
* [RST-2427] Added a 'source' field to the constraints. This is an API-breaking change. (`#101 <https://github.com/locusrobotics/fuse/issues/101>`_)
* [RST-2340] Add serialization support to fuse (`#98 <https://github.com/locusrobotics/fuse/issues/98>`_)
* [RST-2148] Added start() and stop() methods to the MotionModel, SensorModel, and Publisher API (`#75 <https://github.com/locusrobotics/fuse/issues/75>`_)
  * Added start() and stop() methods to the MotionModel, SensorModel, and Publisher API
  * Added the ability to clear the callback queue of the optimizer
  * Refactor the fixed-lag reset callback to use the plugins' stop() and start() methods
* Fix -Wall -Wextra warnings (`#77 <https://github.com/locusrobotics/fuse/issues/77>`_)
* Contributors: Davide Faconti, Enrique Fernandez Perdomo, Stephen Williams, Tom Moore

* Contributors: Stephen Williams

0.3.0 (2019-03-18)
------------------
* [RST-1625] Created a StampedVariableSynchronizer helper class (`#39 <https://github.com/locusrobotics/fuse/issues/39>`_)
* [RST-1653] transaction stamps (`#37 <https://github.com/locusrobotics/fuse/issues/37>`_)
  * Moved the set<ros::Time> object that always accompanies a Transaction into the Transaction itself.
  * Updated all related classes to support that change
* Contributors: Stephen Williams
