 * @brief A constraint that represents either prior information about a 2D pose, or a direct measurement of the 2D pose.
 *
 * A 2D pose is the combination of a 2D position and a 2D orientation variable. As a convenience, this class applies
 * an absolute constraint on both variables at once. This type of constraint arises in many situations. In mapping
 * it is common to define the very first pose as the origin. Some sensors, such as GPS, provide direct measurements
 * of the robot's pose in the global frame. And localization systems often match laserscans to a prior map
 * (scan-to-map measurements). This constraint holds the measured 2D pose and the measurement uncertainty/covariance.
 * It also permits measurement of a subset of the pose provided in the position and orientation varables.
