/**
 * @brief Create a prior cost function on the marker position, minimising reprojection error.
 *
 * The Ceres::NormalPrior cost function only supports a single variable. This is a convenience cost function that
 * applies a prior constraint on the 3D position, orientation and calibration variables at once.
 *
 * The cost function is of the form:
 *
 *   cost(x) = || A * (K * [R_q | p] * [R_{b(3:6)} | b(0:2))] * X - x) ||
 *
 * where, the matrix A and the vector b are fixed, p is the camera position variable, and q is the camera orientation
 * variable, K is the calibration matrix created from the calibration variable, X is the set of marker 3D points,
 * R_b(0:3) is the Rotation matrix from the fixed landmark orentation (b(3:6)), b(0:2) is the fixed landmark position
 * and x is the 2D observations.
 *
 * Note that the covariance submatrix for the quaternion is 3x3, representing errors in the orientation local
 * parameterization tangent space. In case the user is interested in implementing a cost function of the form
 *
 *   cost(X) = (X - mu)^T S^{-1} (X - mu)
 *
 * where, mu is a vector and S is a covariance matrix, then, A = S^{-1/2}, i.e the matrix A is the square root
 * information matrix (the inverse of the covariance).
