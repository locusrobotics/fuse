 * variable is eliminated from the system, the resulting reduced system is independent of the eliminated variable.
 * By eliminating theÂ "marginalized variables" first, all of the "additional connected variables" will remain in the
 * system, but they will not depend on any of the "marginalized variables"...which is what we want.
 *
 * This function uses CCOLAMD to find a good elimination order that eliminates all the "marginalized variables"
 * first.
