 * @brief Compute an efficient elimination order that places the marginalized variables before the additional variables
 *
 * Each time a variable is eliminated from the system, the resulting reduced system is independent of the
 * eliminated variable. By eliminating theÂ "to be marginalized variables" first, all of the
 * "additional connected variables" will remain in the system, but they will not depend on any of the
 * "to be marginalized variables"...which is what we want.
 *
 * This function uses CCOLAMD to find a good elimination order that eliminates all the "to be marginalized variables"
 * first.
 *
 * @param[in] to_be_marginalized The variable UUIDs to be marginalized out
 * @param[in] constraints        All constraints that involve at least one marginalized variable
 * @return The variable UUIDs in the computed elimination order
