/**
 * @brief Implements a cost function that models a difference between pose variables.
 *
 * A single pose involves two variables: a 2D position and a 2D orientation. The generic NormalDelta cost function
 * only supports a single variable type, and computes the difference using per-element subtraction. This cost function
 * computes the difference using standard 2D transformation math:
 *
 *   delta = [R1 | t1]^-1 * [R2 | t2]
 *
 * where R1 and R2 are 2D rotation matrices formed from the 2D orientation variables, and t1 and t2 are the position
 * variables in vector form. Once the delta is computed, the difference between the computed delta and the expected
 * delta uses simple per-element subtraction.
 *
 *             ||    [ delta.x   - b(0)] ||^2
 *   cost(x) = ||A * [ delta.y   - b(1)] ||
 *             ||    [ delta.yaw - b(2)] ||
 *
 * Here, the matrix A can be of variable size, thereby permitting the computation of errors for partial measurements.
 * The vector b is a fixed-size 3x1. In case the user is interested in implementing a cost function of the form:
 *
 *   cost(X) = (X - mu)^T S^{-1} (X - mu)
 *
 * where mu is a vector and S is a covariance matrix, then, A = S^{-1/2}, i.e the matrix A is the square root
 * information matrix (the inverse of the covariance).
