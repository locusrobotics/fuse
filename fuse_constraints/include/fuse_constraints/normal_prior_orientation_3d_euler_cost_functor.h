 * @brief Create a prior cost function on a 3D orientation variable using Euler roll, pitch, and yaw measurements
 *
 * The functor can compute the cost of a subset of the axes, in the event that we are not interested in all the Euler
 * angles in the variable.
 *
 * So, for example, if
 * b_ = [ measured_yaw  ]
 *      [ meausred_roll ]
 *
 * then the cost function is of the form:
 *
 *   cost(x) = || A * [ yaw(x)  - b_(0) ] ||^2
 *             ||     [ roll(x) - b_(1) ] ||
 *
 * where the matrix A and the vector b are fixed and (roll, pitch, yaw) are the components of the 3D orientation
 * variable.
 *
 * In case the user is interested in implementing a cost function of the form
 *
 *   cost(X) = (X - mu)^T S^{-1} (X - mu)
 *
 * where, mu is a vector and S is a covariance matrix, then, A = S^{-1/2}, i.e the matrix A is the square root
 * information matrix (the inverse of the covariance).
