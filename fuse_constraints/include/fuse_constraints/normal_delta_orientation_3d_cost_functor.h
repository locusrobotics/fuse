/**
 * @brief Implements a cost function that models a difference between 3D orientation variables (quaternion)
 *
 * The cost function is of the form:
 *
 *             ||                                  ||^2
 *   cost(x) = || A * AngleAxis(b^-1 * q1^-1 * q2) ||
 *             ||                                  ||
 *
 * where the matrix A and the vector b are fixed, and q1 and q2 are the variables, represented as quaternions.
 * The AngleAxis function converts a quaternion into a 3-vector of the form theta*k, where k is the unit vector axis
 * of rotation and theta is the angle of rotation. The A matrix is applied to the angle-axis 3-vector.
 *
 * In case the user is interested in implementing a cost function of the form
 *
 *   cost(X) = (X - mu)^T S^{-1} (X - mu)
 *
 * where, mu is a vector and S is a covariance matrix, then, A = S^{-1/2}, i.e the matrix A is the square root
 * information matrix (the inverse of the covariance).
