 * @brief This is a concrete implementation of the Graph interface using hashmaps to store the constraints and variables.
 *
 * This is reasonable graph implementation when a large number of variables and constraints are expected, such as with
 * full SLAM and mapping applications. The hashmap overhead may be too expensive for use in high-frequency systems with
 * a basically fixed graph size. Something base on a boost::flat_map or similar may perform better in those situations.
 * The final decision on the graph type should be based actual performance testing.
 * 
 * This class is not thread-safe. If used in a multi-threaded application, standard thread synchronization techniques
 * should be used to guard access to the graph.
